I was privileged to be selected as a volunteer for the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics. During the opening and closing ceremonies of both the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games and the Beijing 2022 Paralympic Winter Games, held at the Bird's Nest, I was responsible for guiding the flow of audiences. Due to my excellent performance during these events, I was honored with the award of **"Advanced Individual of Tsinghua University in the Beijing 2022 Olympic and Paralympic Winter Games"**.

In addition, I have participated in over 400 hours of volunteer activities through the Beijing Volunteer Service Federation (BVF) platform and have been recognized as a **"Five-Star Volunteer of Tsinghua University"**.
